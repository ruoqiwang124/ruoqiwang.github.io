## Welcome!

I’m Ruoqi Wang, an undergraduate student majoring in **Mathematics & Computer Science** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**.  
This portfolio brings together a selection of interactive systems, game design prototypes, and software projects developed through coursework and independent work.

My projects explore the intersection of **narrative design, system design, and technical implementation**, with a focus on building clear, engaging, and user-centered interactive experiences.
